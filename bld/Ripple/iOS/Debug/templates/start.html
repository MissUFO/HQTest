                <p>Remember, to get an accurate score, you must answer the questions honestly, else your score will be skewed. Once the test is complete, you will be presented with your score and result (pass/fail).</p>
                <p>Depending on your score, you may inquire as to why you received the score you did after your results are displayed.</p>
                <p>Because this is a test to see if you are good enough to get to Heaven, and God is the gatekeeper (for lack of a better term), we are going to use God's law, the Ten Commandments from the Old Testament, to act as our "measuring stick" of how good you are.</p>
                <p>Are you ready?</p>
