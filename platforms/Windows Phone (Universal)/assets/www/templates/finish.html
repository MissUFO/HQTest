            <h1>Test result: <span class="red">FAIL</span></h1>
            <h2>Why Did I Fail?</h2>
            <p>
                By reviewing the answers to the HQ Test you just completed, the reason you failed is because you have
                violated one (or more) of God's laws. God [Don't believe in God?] calls this sin. You're not alone in this,
                however, because the Bible [Don't believe the Bible?] says that everyone has sinned. [1] By committing sin
                (even one), you have earned for yourself a sentence in Hell for eternity, as the Bible says that the payment, or consequence, for sin is death--spiritual death, which is eternal seperation from God in Hell.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
                Even if we assume for the sake of argument that you have never sinned, there is still absolutely no way to
                get into heaven if you are attempting to do so on your own merit. The Bible says that we are saved "by grace [What is grace?] through faith" and "not of works." [3] There is no way to get into Heaven by doing good things (or even by not doing bad things)--your good is not good enough. [4] So if being good doesn't get you into heaven, what does?

            <h2>If you have prayed and trusted Jesus, the following took place:</h2>
            <p>
                1. Your sins were forgiven (Colossians 1:14 "In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the
                forgiveness of sins.")
            </p>
            <p>
                2. You became a child of God (John 1:12 "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become
                the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.")
            </p>
            <p>
                3. You were made an heir to all of God's blessings (Romans 8:16,17 "The Spirit itself bears witness with
                our spirit, that we are the children of God: And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
                Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.")
            </p>
            <p>
                4. You now possess everlasting life (1 John 5:12,13 "He who has the Son has life; he who does not have
                the Son of God does not have life. I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God
                so that you may know that you have eternal life.")
